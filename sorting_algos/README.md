# Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

# Radix sort
Radix sort groups positive integers by the value of a position in the number. First the one's place is compared, then the ten's, etc.
The numbers are repeatedly sorted into buckets and then flattened until all the positions have been examined.
